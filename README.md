# badOTP
A worse version of the OTP with some benefits. 


In the python package is a short documentation.


This is a small Python Package for encrypting and decrypting files, badOTP uses a modified version of the One Time Pad (i think).


Pros:
  - smaller passwords
  - kinda lightweight
  - only transforms data so brute forcing will have a hard time determining if it was succsesfull  

Cons:
  - can have weak passwords
  - probably glitchy AF
